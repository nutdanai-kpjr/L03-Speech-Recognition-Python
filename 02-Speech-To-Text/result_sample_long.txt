English learning Psychology psychology is 80% of success. Method is only 20%. Tony Robbins Peak Performance Coach most English learners are very intelligent. Most are highly motivated when they begin. Most students are very successful in school, in their jobs, in their businesses and in their relationships. So why do so many fail to speak English easily and quickly? What is the problem? Why do people who are normally so successful fail in this one area? There are two answers to that question. One bad methods. Number two bad psychology. Learn English, Methods and Psychology. I talk a lot about methods. As you know, the grammar and textbook methods used in schools are terrible. They are total failures. Very few people will learn to speak English easily if they use those methods. That's why I developed the effortless English system. It is a system designed to help you speak and understand real English. But even if you use my system, it's not enough. Tony Robbins is right. A great method is still only 20% of success. The other 80% is psychology. Psychology means motivation, energy, beliefs, rules, standards and emotions. When learning English, psychology is very important. To succeed as an excellent English speaker, you must learn to manage your emotions. You must develop a psychology of success. One key way to do this is to manage your emotional states.

For example, if you are frequently tired, bored, depressed, you will struggle to study English consistently. You will have poor concentration. Your memory will be worse. You will be more likely to quit or to study in a distracted or lazy way. You must learn to master your emotions.
